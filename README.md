# Templates
This repo contains a collection of professionally designed templates to help you get started styling your docs.  Please feel free to continue customizing them or start from scratch to get the look you're after.  You can learn more [on our online docs](http://docs.helppag.es).

## Contributing
If you create something awesome and want to see it included in the official templates list, just submit a pull request with a new template folder with a `stylesheet.css`, `README.md` and `screenshot.png` file.
